# sample-site #

Sample website for learning purposes. Used xampp stack (apache, mysql) as a platform. 

Started with notes from freecodecamp tutorials and kept adding some of my own pieces.

Site still uses mostly static pages. 

Usage: simply put the folder to ../xampp/htdocs folder. Run xampp stack. Site accessible through localhost/freecodecamp/pages/index.php .

There are still plenty of work to be done, noticeable additions include: rework/move the whole project to a framework (would likely improve code usability, site security and other); user creation/authentication (which would mean more tables in the DB); more TBD;

Major changes so far:
Added some "dynamic" pages (mainly a page that displays all uploaded photos);
Added user creation/authentication;
Some extra functions;

Major update now would be to start using some framework.
