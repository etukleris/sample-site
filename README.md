# sample-site #

Sample website for learning purposes. Used xampp stack (apache, mysql) as a platform. Moved onto codeigniter as a framework.

Started with notes from freecodecamp tutorials and kept adding and adding some of my own pieces.

Usage: simply put the folder to ../xampp/htdocs folder. Run xampp stack. Site accessible through localhost/test-site/index.php/pages/view/index (will be working on to change the name into something simpler) .


Major changes so far:
Added image upload;
Added some "dynamic" pages (mainly a page that displays all uploaded photos);
Added user creation/authentication; User profile page with image upload
Some extra functions;
Moved onto codeigniter framework
